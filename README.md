## Django


1. Implement the ability to register on the site and enter the site.
2. Possibility of adding a new author to the site, only for a registered user.
3. The ability to add a new quote to the site, indicating the author, only for a registered user.
4. Migrate the MongoDB database you have to Postgres for your site. It can be implemented with a custom script. (If you wish, you can leave and work with quotes and authors in MongoDB, and with users in Postgres).
5. You can go to the page of each author without user authentication.
6. All quotes are viewable without user authentication.
